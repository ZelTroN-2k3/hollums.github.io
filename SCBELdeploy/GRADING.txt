3 Levels: Parallax Scrolling feel of depth, Camera View Smaller -
	I have 3 layers in Level 1 and Level 3, while Level 2 has other elements 
	into play that make parallax scrolling uneccessary.  (Indoor level).

Splash Screen:
	I have a splash screen for opening the game, and a prelude to each level
	giving some back story, as well as a closing dialogue.

Sprite, Main Player:
	Main player is modeled after myself, including in the opening screen.
	All animations were made with considerable time and care to create 
	a dynamic and unique experience.

Sprite, Main Player Dynamics:
	Running, Falling, Jumping, Swimming (can be done at the end of Level 3),
	Flying, Climbing, and Swinging are all animations and actions in the game,
	and each of these motions have several different frames to create a smooth
	animation.

Friendly Sprites:
	Health packs scattered around maps that provide the player with a boost
	of health over a fixed regeneration period.  In addition to the health-
	packs, there is a Medivac in the game that rescues the player.

Enemy Sprites:
	There are three different enemy types, one is static (baneling land mine),
	the others are highly mobile and animated.

Player Attributes:
	Due to the difficulty of the game, there are infinite lives.  To make up for
	this feature however, I have included a second bar below the health bar that
	keeps track of a regenerating fuel source for flying.

Documentation:
	Included in this folder are the grading.txt, readme.txt, programming,
	and report.txt files. Screen shots are also included.

Demo:
	Done in class.
