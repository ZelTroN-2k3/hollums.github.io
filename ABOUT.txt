PAC-MAN: GLOVES ARE OFF!!!

Inspired by "Geometry Wars," this is a shooting game with an Asteroids gameplay style, 
but with a little twist! We all know the classic arcade game "Pac-Man," but in this version,
our hero has grown tired of running from those pesky ghosts.

The time is nigh for action, and Pac-Man is packing.

Fend off the oncoming waves of ghosts with the pellets Pac-Man has coveted his whole life,
saving up for this moment. When you're in a bind, use special abilities to wipe out multiple 
enemies, or to dodge the spooky ghosts.

Like any classic arcade game, this is a game about getting a high score.  In each round,
Pac-Man's level scales with the score.  With each new level, Pac-Man's abilities grow
stronger and become more readily available to use.  Unfortunately, the difficulty of the
round also increases with the score, so it's no easy task to reach the highest level. 

Dive in and see how many ghosts you can fend off!
