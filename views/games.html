			 <gametitle>Open Corey's Door</gametitle><br>
			 This game was created from start to finish in 48 hours by myself and three other developers for a Global Game Jam competition. Our game puts you in the steps of Corey, our OCD friend, who has many rituals to perform prior to starting his day. You must repeat multiple steps in order, by memory, to open the front door of your house. Each day brings a new challenge as the memory puzzles become exponentially harder and longer.

Jump into valley like environment, find a tool, gather supplies, and build a shelter. If you light a fire, you might even be able to light a torch and explore some caves.

			Not exactly a game, but a site for games!  Ever heard of Rotten Tomatoes? Well our team designed a Rotten Tomatoes-esque site for crowd sourcing reviews from gamers like you and me.  My role in this project was to sketch wireframes / design the front end of the application using the Twitter Bootstrap framework, as well as designing banners/logos/icons for the site using Adobe Photoshop.  Go ahead and check it out! Sign up and review some of our games, and maybe we'll dress this up / develop it even further!

			<gametitle>A* Pathfinder!</gametitle><br>
			A pathfinding program implemented in Java.  Eventually I may extend this to an embedded web application to view like the others listed above, but for now I am just supplying my code. Instructions on how to run this are on the download page.  This program allows you to get a glimpse at how some games may find optimal paths from one object to another in the game environment.  Included on the side of the GUI is a slider for adjusting the speed - allows a more in depth look at the algorithm, as well as a chooser for selecting different maps to run.

			<gametitle>Snake!</gametitle><br>
			Busting out the big guns here! This was the first game I ever made with a GUI (Graphical User Interface).  It was coded in Java during my CSCI1302 class. Needless to say, it's not that impressive, but for nostalgia purposes, it's great.  The rules are simple: the snake eats the food, he gets bigger, the snake starts moving faster and can not collide with either his body or any walls. Go for a high score!  Like the Astar game, this is a java program. To run it requires a download and a small amount of commands to run.
			Instructions are in the link.

			<gametitle>Reversi</gametitle><br>
			For those of you more comfortable reading from the terminal/command prompt - this is a version of the classic game "Reversi".  This game has no GUI, but was the first *complicated* game I took on as a project in school.  This involves two difficulties of AI, and the player can even play a buddy! (on the same computer of course.) If you're not familar with reversi, take a look <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/reversi.html">here</a>.  If time permits, I will get around to creating this game with a GUI.
