			<gametitle>Unity Final Project</gametitle><br>
			A simplistic game in Unity designed for CSCI4070 - Game Programming class that had to meet specific requirements: day and night cycle, resemble mine craft in concept (gathering/building objects to survive), and fend off basic enemies.  Jump into valley like environment, find a tool, gather supplies, and build a shelter. If you light a fire, you might even be able to light a torch and explore some caves.

			<gametitle>Game Review Site</gametitle><br>
			Not exactly a game, but a site for games!  Ever heard of Rotten Tomatoes? Well our team designed a Rotten Tomatoes-esque site for crowd sourcing reviews from gamers like you and me.  My role in this project was to sketch wireframes / design the front end of the application using the Twitter Bootstrap framework, as well as designing banners/logos/icons for the site using Adobe Photoshop.  Go ahead and check it out! Sign up and review some of our games, and maybe we'll dress this up / develop it even further!

			<gametitle>A* Pathfinder!</gametitle><br>
			A pathfinding program implemented in Java.  Eventually I may extend this to an embedded web application to view like the others listed above, but for now I am just supplying my code. Instructions on how to run this are on the download page.  This program allows you to get a glimpse at how some games may find optimal paths from one object to another in the game environment.  Included on the side of the GUI is a slider for adjusting the speed - allows a more in depth look at the algorithm, as well as a chooser for selecting different maps to run.

			<gametitle>Snake!</gametitle><br>
			Busting out the big guns here! This was the first game I ever made with a GUI (Graphical User Interface).  It was coded in Java during my CSCI1302 class. Needless to say, it's not that impressive, but for nostalgia purposes, it's great.  The rules are simple: the snake eats the food, he gets bigger, the snake starts moving faster and can not collide with either his body or any walls. Go for a high score!  Like the Astar game, this is a java program. To run it requires a download and a small amount of commands to run.
			Instructions are in the link.

			<gametitle>Reversi</gametitle><br>
			For those of you more comfortable reading from the terminal/command prompt - this is a version of the classic game "Reversi".  This game has no GUI, but was the first *complicated* game I took on as a project in school.  This involves two difficulties of AI, and the player can even play a buddy! (on the same computer of course.) If you're not familar with reversi, take a look <a href="http://www.mathsisfun.com/games/reversi.html">here</a>.  If time permits, I will get around to creating this game with a GUI.
