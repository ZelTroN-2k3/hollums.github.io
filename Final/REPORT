REPORT

I implemented a Unity 3D with an expansive environment that includes a periodic
system of night and day. 

The player is immersed in the world with a few tasks:

Immediately, the player is prompted that he should build a shelter where he spawns.

The game hints also that there is a tool to be found in the world to gather with.

The world is riddled with enemies and the player must be cautious when he has no
weapons to defend himself with.

Once the player finds the Axe, he can gather wood from special trees, and kill
enemies to gather parts / hardware.

After gathering enough supplies and hardware, the player will likely be approaching
night time, so he will head back to the enclave he started and use the supplies to
build the house.

Once the house is built, the player can collect the matches inside and restock on
health with a "power cell," then head back outside to light the fire.

After lighting the fire, the player acquires a torch.  The torch supplies light and
comfort exploring at night, so the new task is to explore for a cave and find water.

Once the player locates the cave, he will be immersed in a series of winding tunnels
in the maze that the cave offers.  Inside, there are enemies lurking.

The conclusion of the game arrives when the player finds the exit to the cave.

From the exit, the player is dropped into the familiar world of the unity tutorial
map, as required in the project description.

HOW IT WORKS/DISCUSSION ON THE RESULTS:

The game involves a number of scripts for several prefabs created.  I found the
model for the Axe online.  Overall, the game turned out well.  I wish I had more time
to create enemy models that would be more interesting.  But the unity model 
for enemies was good enough for the game play purposes.  Also, I wish that I had
time to implement more exciting combat features for enemies and the player, including
more weapons and abilities.
